Co-taught week-long science summer camps at the Morehead Planetarium and Science Center to students entering Grades 6-8, 4-5, and 2-3

## SciVentures: ROVing the Universe

*Grades 6-8*, 1-week long camp, 06/12/2023- 06/30/2023  

* Campers learned about the limits of exploration and why scientists use Remote Operated Vehicles (ROVs) in places too extreme for humans  
* Campers worked in teams to complete "Ocean" and "Mars" challenges which simulated real-life missions where they applied ROV science principles such as Archimedes Principle, Buoyancy, Newton's Three Laws, Collecting/Analyzing Data, and Engineering Design Concepts  
* Campers created blog posts to showcase their scientific findings and summarized activities done throughout the day. These blogs can be found on the web.
