### Switching Labs  
You can attend ANY lab, BUT you must **submit your assignments for the DUE DATE for the lab you are ENROLLED in.**  

### Lab Grading  

* **5/5** if the lab is **Completed**. Mistakes are totally fine, as long as there's work for all problems  
* **(1-4)/5** partial completion with **1/5** corresponding to a **20%** completion and **4/5** corresponding to a **80%** completion  
* **0/5** if there's **no work = no credit!**  
* **YOU NEED TO TURN IN ALL THE LABS TO PASS THE COURSE !**  

### Attendance  

I don't take attendance, y'all are adults.  

### Assignment Due Dates
