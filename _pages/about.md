Hi! My name is Cindy J. Pang and welcome to my site!  

I am a first-year Biostatistics PhD student at UCLA Fielding School of Public Health with interests in spatial statistics, disease surveillance, and Bayesian hierarchical modeling. In other words, I am interested in making maps and understanding how space and place result in good (or bad) health outcomes.  

I (recently) graduated from UNC-Chapel Hill with a BPSH in Biostatistics and BA in Mathematics in 2023 (the Jordan year!!!). At UNC-Chapel Hill, I was an undergraduate research assistant at the [Carolina Population Center](https://www.cpc.unc.edu/) under the supervision of [Dr. Paul Delamater](https://www.cpc.unc.edu/people/fellows/paul-delamater/) where I summarized the [relationship between pre-existing immunity levels and COVID-19 outcomes during the Delta Wave in North Carolina counties](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9838034/) and worked on estimating COVID-19 disease incidence during the pre-vaccination era for North Carolina counties with Monte Carlo Simulation and hierarchical models.

Outside of research, I am an avid Swiftie, foodie, yogi, travel wannabe (money permitting), and you can find me cheering on the Tar Heels (UNC) and Bruins (UCLA) in college men's basketball. Though if UNC and UCLA go head-to-head, then by rule, I cheer on the Tar Heels because they are my alma mater. I enjoy spending time with my 6-year old golden retriever, Laken, and petting dogs wherever I go.
