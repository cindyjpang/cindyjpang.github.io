Hi! My name is Cindy J. Pang and welcome to my site!  

I am a PhD student in the Department of Biostatistics at the UCLA Fielding School
of Public Health, supervised by Dr. Sudipto Banerjee. My research interests are in Bayesian
hierarchical modelling for Big Data (or ‘Big N’) problems, high-dimensional data, with
applications to public health problems.  

I recently graduated from UNC-Chapel Hill with a BSPH in Biostatistics and a BA in
Mathematics in May 2023. At UNC, she was an undergraduate research assistant at the Carolina
Population Center supervised by Dr. Paul Delamater where her research focused on summarizing
the relationship between pre-existing immunity levels and COVID-19 outcomes during the Delta Wave in North Carolina counties and estimating COVID-19 disease incidence during the pre-
vaccination era for North Carolina counties with Monte Carlo simulation and hierarchical models  

Outside of the academic realm, you can find me singing (very badly) to Taylor Swift songs,
collecting squishmallows, petting dogs, watching dog videos, reading (currently obsessed with fantasy novels) and cheering for the UNC Men’s Basketball team. I also enjoy spending time with her 7-year-old golden retriever, Laken.
